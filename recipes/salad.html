    <h1>Briscoe's "Bucket of Vegetables" Salad</h1>
    <img src="../assets/salad.jpeg" alt="Briscoe's Bucket of Vegetables Salad on a picnic table" width="1600" height="1200">
    <p>This is a salad invented by Briscoe to include a <strong>lot of vegetables</strong> as well as <strong>beans</strong> and <strong>tofu</strong>.</p>
    <p>The idea behind the salad is to have an easy to meal-prep meal that keeps acceptably well in the fridge for <b>up to 8 days</b>. The recommended approach is to make the salad in bulk on a Saturday or Sunday, and then portion the salad out over each weekday. This typically yield about 6 regular portions, or 5 heavy portions.</p>
    <p>The beauty of this recipe is that you can use nearly <em>any</em> vegetables that you like or have to use up. It is really that versatile. Unfortunately, however, it does not taste very good.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>120g bag of rocket lettuce</li>
